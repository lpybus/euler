PROJECT EULER SOLUTIONS
=======================

These are my solutions. I was able to work out the first two myself without much assistance to speak of.
On the third, I needed some help figuring out how to write the isPrime function, and then got the cue to
iterate backwards from the top to find the highest prime number from someone else as well. I *still*
couldn't get my code to run, so I checked it pretty much line for line with another guy, before I
realized my problem was re-using a variable too much. You can kind of see this in the version history.

I started working on Problem 4, and got close, I think, but haven't quite nailed it. For the purposes of
our coding group (HFAC @ NCSU), I would consider this a bonus. Nobody else needs to commit to doing it
unless they want to. If you figure it out independently, I'd love for some comments on my solution.
